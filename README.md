## Challenges faced

1. Difficulty while styling MUI components such as headers on the Project information Intake form page to replicate the Figma, thanks to Grepper and StackOverflow's public contribution of submitting solutions.
2. Was not able to replicate the React-Flow for example styling the connector edge between nodes and removing the connector dot as given on the Figma and I got the solutions on its own Library React-flow documentation.
3. Got a little difficulty while adding the Automation workflow functionality of adding new components at the end of the component and it took me 2 hours to solve the problem.
